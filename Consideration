  1. Attachments with a Multipurpose Internet Mail Extension (MIME) type of text
  2. Attachments with a MIME type of application/octet-stream and a file name that ends with either a .vcf or .vcs extension. These are saved as text/x-vcard and text/calendar MIME types, respectively.
  3. binary attachments: such as image, audio, application, and video files. Binary attachments have a limit of 5 MB per attachment.
  
  
### NOTE :
  1. If the server fails a protocol or does not support any of the protocols, the email service performs the action specified in the Unauthenticated Sender Actio
  2. Email services reject email messages and notify the sender if the email (combined body text, body HTML, and attachments) exceeds approximately 25 MB
  3. Email services cannot accept inline attachments, such as graphics inserted in email messages.
  4. We can convert text email to binarry or vice versa
  5. email service only to accept messages from certain senders by listing their email addresses and domains in the Accept Email From text box. Separate multiple entries with commas.

  7. To send error email messages to a specified address instead of the sender's email address, select Enable Error Routing and specify the destination email address in Route Error Emails to This Email Address.
